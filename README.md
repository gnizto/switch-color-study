# Theme Switcher

Theme Switcher is a class provided by the [RocketSeat Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rocketseat) on YouTube.

The [video class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyTYr07OM7c) conducted by Mayk Brito is based on another video from [Kevin Powell's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell).

## Objective

The main objective here is to use a new feature from the CSS, a relational pseudo-class called `:has()` to create a logic for changing the document theme, allowing to use only HTML and CSS. 

By the way, since `:has()` is quite new, some browser don't support it, for that reason a JavaScript fallback is used to workaround the limitation and allowing the feature usage on all browsers.

**NOTE**: If you read this after publishing, please refer to [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=has()) and check the support on the pseudo-class cited.
